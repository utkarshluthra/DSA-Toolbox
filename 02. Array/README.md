# Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory location of the same type
Arrays are easier to index and to find an element
Generally, arrays have a fixed size to it.

### Pros
1. Arrays allow random access to elements making accessing elements faster
2. Arrays have a very good cache locality that makes a pretty big ifference in performance.
3. Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type in the same variable name.

### Cons
1. Cannot change the size of an array.
2. Insertion/deletion of a new element in the middle of the array is difficult and costly

### Application**
* To store data elements of the same data type
* Used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps etc.

### Implementation
To make an array in C++:
```
int arr[5]={0,1,2,3,4}
```

### Important Problems to solve:**
1. Reverse the array
2. Find the maximum and minimum element in the array
3. Find the 'Kth' max and min element in the array
4. Given an array which consists of only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array without using any sorting algorithm
5. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array
6. Find the union and intersections of the two arrays
5. Write a program to cyclically rotate an array by one.
6. *Find the largest sum contiguous sub-array*
7. *Minimise the maximum difference between heights*
8. Mininimum number of jumps to reach end of an array/
9. Find duplicate in an array of n+1 integers
10. Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space
11. **Kadane's Algorithm**
12. Merge Intervals
13. Next Permutation
14. Count Inversion
15. Best time to buy and sell stock
16. Find all pairs on integer array whose sum is equal to given number
17. Find common elements in three sorted arrays
18. Rearrange the array in alrernating positive and negative items with O(1) extra space
19. Find if there is any subarray with sum equal to 0.
20. Find factorial of a large number
21. Find the maximum product subarray
22. Find the longest consecutive subsequence
23. Given an array of size n and a number k, find all the elements that appear more than "n/k" times.
24. Maximum profit by buying and selling a share atmost twice
25. Find whether an array is a subset of another array
26. Find the triplet that sum to a given value
27. Trapping Rain Water problem
28. Chocolate Distribution Problem
29. Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value
30. Three way partitioning of an array around a given value
31. Minimum number of operations required to make an array palindromic
32. Median of 2 sorted arrays of equal size
33. Median of 2 sorted arrays of different size
